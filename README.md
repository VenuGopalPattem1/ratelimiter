This project is a production-style Distributed Rate Limiter built using Spring Boot and Redis. It supports multiple rate limiting algorithms (Token Bucket & Fixed Window) with dynamic algorithm switching via configuration. The system enforces different rate limits for different APIs, along with per-user and per-IP request control. A global Spring filter ensures that all incoming requests are validated before reaching controllers, and blocked requests receive a proper HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response.
