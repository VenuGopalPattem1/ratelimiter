Distributed Rate Limiter using Spring Boot & Redis
Built a Redis-based distributed rate limiter using Spring Boot supporting Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms with config-driven algorithm switching. Implemented per-API different rate limits, per-user and per-IP throttling, and global enforcement using Spring Filter with proper HTTP 429 handling for blocked requests.
